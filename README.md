## 🔍 Project Methodology (CRISP-DM)

### 1️⃣ Business Understanding

* Studied insurance premium pricing logic and underwriting principles
* Defined analytical goals aligned with business impact

### 2️⃣ Data Understanding

* Analyzed customer demographics, property details, claims, and payment behavior
* Identified numerical and categorical variables influencing premium pricing

### 3️⃣ Data Preparation

* Handled missing values and duplicate records
* Corrected data types and ensured data consistency
* Created derived features such as **Age Group** and **Income Group**

### 4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed detailed EDA to uncover trends, relationships, and risk patterns:

* Univariate analysis to study distributions and outliers
* Bivariate analysis to identify relationships between risk factors and premiums
* Visual analysis to support interpretability and stakeholder communication

### 5️⃣ Insight Generation & Interpretation

* Converted statistical findings into **business-friendly insights**
* Linked analytical results to insurance pricing and risk decisions

## 📊 Key Analytical Insights

* **Income** is the strongest driver of premium affordability
* **Property value** strongly correlates with claim amount and premium size
* **Urban locations** attract higher premiums due to higher risk exposure
* **Older houses** show higher claim frequency
* **Low-income customers** face higher payment delays or defaults

---

## 👥 Customer Segmentation Insights

**Customers Likely to Pay Higher Premiums**

* High-income customers
* Urban residents
* Middle-aged customers (30–50 years)
* Owners of high-value properties

**Customers Facing Payment Challenges**

* Low-income customers
* Owners of older properties
* Customers with frequent claim history

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations
